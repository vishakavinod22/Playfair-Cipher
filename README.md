# Problem Statement
Write a program to simulate the Playfair substitution cipher.

## Description
Your program should have three methods/functions:  
**Method 1**: Accepts a secret key (String of characters) as argument and generates and returns a key matrix (2D array).  
**Method 2:** Accepts plaintext (String of characters) and the key matrix as arguments and generates and returns the ciphertext.  
**Method 3:** Accepts ciphertext (String of characters) and the key matrix as arguments and generates and returns the plaintext.

## Assumptions
Assume that the plaintext, ciphertext and the key all consist of only upper-case letters. Ignore spaces, punctuations, and line breaks.

## Example
**Sample secret key:** RAYQUAZA  
**Sample plaintext:** POKEMON TOWER DEFENSE  
YOUR MISSION IN THIS FUN STRATEGY TOWER DEFENSE GAME IS TO HELP PROFESSOR OAK TO STOP ATTACKS OF WILD RATTATA. SET OUT ON YOUR OWN POKEMON JOURNEY, TO CATCH AND TRAIN ALL POKEMON AND TRY TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY BEHIND THESE ATTACKS. YOU MUST PLACE POKEMON CHARACTERS STRATEGICALLY ON THE BATTLEFIELD SO THAT THEY STOP ALL WAVES OF ENEMY ATTACKER
DURING THE BATTLE YOU WILL LEVEL UP AND EVOLVE YOUR POKEMON.  
YOU CAN ALSO CAPTURE OTHER POKEMON DURING THE BATTLE AND ADD THEM TO YOUR TEAM. USE YOUR MOUSE TO PLAY THE GAME. GOOD LUCK
